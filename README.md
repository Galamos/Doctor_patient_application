# Recommender system algorithm implementations for a Doctor-patient matchmaking application
The aim of this project was to investigate the most appropriate recommendation approach in terms accuracy of prediction power for a doctor-patient matchmaking application. The three main recommender systems were implemented i.e. Content-Based, Collaborative Filtering and a Hybrid approach. These approached are then evaluated given the data at hand in order to compare accuracy of prediction power of each recommender system.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Anaconda3 is the best environment to use for running this project

### Installing

The following are the list of installations to be made in order to be able to run the project

Step 1 - Download and install Anaconda3(https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

Step 2 - Once Anaconda3 is set up and running, create new development environment.

Step 3 - In the new environment, install Jupyter Notebook and Spyder(to run python file)
